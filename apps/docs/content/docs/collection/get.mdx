The `get()` method retrieves a specific item from your collection by its key. You can either get the entire item state or use a selector to extract specific values. This method is synchronous and ideal for accessing collection data outside of React components.

```tsx
import { createCollection } from 'finalstore';

const users = createCollection({
  states: {
    name: '',
    age: 0,
    active: true
  },
  actions: {
    updateName: (state, name: string) => {
      state.name = name;
    }
  }
});

// Add some user
users.insert('user-1', { name: 'John', age: 25, active: true });

// Get specific item
const user = users.get('user-1');

// Get with selector
const name = users.get('user-1', (state) => state.name);
```
